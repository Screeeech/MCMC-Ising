# Monte-Carlo Markov Chain Ising Model 2023 Spring DRP

In this project, we sample form the Gibbs distribution using the Metropolis Algorithm on a cyclic 2d Ising model and caculate important material properties such as the phase transition temperature and the specific heat capacity. Results are saved in the images folder and
explained in the presentation linked below.
